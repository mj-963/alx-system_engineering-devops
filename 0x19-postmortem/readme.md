#Web Stack Outage - Postmortem

This postmortem document provides an overview of a recent web stack outage that occurred on June 15, 2023, along with the root cause, timeline, resolution, and corrective/preventative measures.
Issue Summary

    Duration: June 15, 2023, 08:00 AM to June 15, 2023, 11:30 AM (PST)
    Impact: Service downtime, slow response times, and errors experienced by all users.
    Root Cause: Misconfigured database connection pool leading to a failure in establishing database connections.

#Timeline

    Issue Detected: June 15, 2023, 08:00 AM (PST) through monitoring alerts.
    Actions Taken:
        Investigated database connectivity.
        Checked application logs and reviewed server health metrics.
    Misleading Investigation:
        Assumed high server load and investigated load balancers and caching systems.
    Escalation: Incident was escalated to the Database Operations team and Senior Systems Engineer.
    Incident Resolution: Identified and corrected the misconfigured database connection pool.

#Root Cause and Resolution

The root cause of the web stack outage was identified as a misconfigured database connection pool. During a recent update to the database configuration files, the maximum connection limit was mistakenly set too low. As a result, the application couldn't establish connections to the database, leading to service downtime and slow response times.

To resolve the issue, the following steps were taken:

    Corrected the database connection pool configuration by increasing the maximum connection limit to an appropriate value.
    Applied the corrected configuration and restarted the application servers to ensure they picked up the changes.
    Restored the database connectivity, bringing the web stack back to normal operation.

#Corrective and Preventative Measures

To prevent similar incidents in the future, the following measures will be implemented:

    Automated Configuration Validation: Develop an automated process to validate configuration changes before deploying them to production, ensuring that misconfigurations are caught early.
    Enhanced Monitoring: Improve monitoring capabilities by implementing real-time alerts for database connectivity issues. Proactively monitor connection pool health and critical database metrics.
    Database Configuration Review: Conduct a comprehensive review of all database configurations to identify and address potential misconfigurations or performance bottlenecks.
    Incident Response Training: Provide additional training to the support team and engineers on incident response procedures, emphasizing efficient troubleshooting and root cause analysis techniques.

#Tasks to Address the Issue

To address the issue and implement the above measures, the following tasks will be performed:

    Patch the database connection pool configuration to increase the maximum connection limit.
    Update the incident response playbook with specific steps for investigating and resolving database connectivity issues.
    Implement an automated configuration validation pipeline to catch misconfigurations.
    Enhance the monitoring system to provide real-time alerts for database connectivity problems.
    Conduct a thorough review of all database configurations to ensure proper settings.
    Organize incident response training sessions for the support team and engineers.

By implementing these corrective and preventative measures, we aim to improve the stability and reliability of our web stack, minimizing the likelihood of similar outages in the future.
